# üß© What is a Terraform Workspace?

Terraform **workspaces** are a feature that enables you to use the **same Terraform configuration** to manage **multiple state files**. This is useful when you want to deploy the same infrastructure in different environments (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`) **without duplicating code**.

---

## üîÑ Default Behavior

By default, 
Terraform has a single workspace named `default`. When you initialize Terraform, it stores the state in `terraform.tfstate` under this workspace.

---

## üß™ Why Use Workspaces?

Workspaces allow you to:
- Maintain **isolated state** per environment
- Reuse the same **configuration**
- Avoid manually editing state or duplicating Terraform code


---

## üß∞ Common Workspace Commands

```bash
terraform workspace list #Lists all existing workspaces.
terraform workspace new <name> # Creates a new workspace (e.g., dev, prod).
terraform workspace select <name> # Switches to an existing workspace.
terraform workspace show  # Displays the currently active workspace.
```

### How Workspaces Affect State

Each workspace has its own state file. If using local backend, they are stored in:

* Local Env :

```bash
terraform.tfstate.d/<workspace_name>/terraform.tfstate

```

* AWS Remote backend:

can use : ${terraform.workspace}

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key    = "envs/${terraform.workspace}/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}

```

```bash
terraform workspace new dev
terraform apply     # deploys infrastructure to dev

terraform workspace new prod
terraform apply     # deploys infrastructure to prod
```

## Terraform Remote State

### Example using S3:

```hcl
## ‚öôÔ∏è Example: Using S3 as a Remote Backend

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "envs/prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"   # for state locking (optional but recommended)
  }
}
```

###  Sharing Remote State Between Modules

Sometimes, one module or project needs to reference outputs from another module's state.

You can use **terraform_remote_state** data source:

```hcl

data "terraform_remote_state" "network" {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key    = "envs/prod/network/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}

output "vpc_id" {
  value = data.terraform_remote_state.network.outputs.vpc_id
}
```

Terraform remote state ensures your infrastructure state is:
* Safe
* Shared
* Recoverable
* Secure
